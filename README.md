Having a Good Time With Data Wrangling 
Data wrangling is the process of converting raw data into a usable form. It may also be called data munging or data remediation.
Data wrangling describes a series of processes designed to explore, transform, and validate raw datasets from their messy and complex forms into high-quality data. You can use your wrangled data to produce valuable insights and guide business decisions. 
There are four broad steps in the munging process:
Discovery
Transformation
Validation
Publishing

Data wrangling prepares your data for the data mining process, which is the stage of analysis when you look for patterns or relationships in your dataset that can guide actionable insights.

Your data analysis can only be as good as the data itself. If you analyze bad data, it's likely that you'll draw ill-informed conclusions and won't be able to make reliable, data-informed decisions.
